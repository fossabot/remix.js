Welcome to Echo Nest Remix: The (JavaScript) Internet Synthesizer

Echo Nest Remix is **the Internet Synthesizer.** 
Make amazing things from music, automatically.  Turn any music Javascript code, cut it up, move through it, and control it.

It is based on code from the mighty [Infinite Jukebox](http://www.infinitejuke.com/ ""), 
and makes use of the WebAudio API to cut, queue, and remix music.

## Getting Started
We've made a shiny new page for working with Remix: [check it out.](http://echonest.github.com/remix/javascript.html) 
This is a new project, so things may change very rapidly - let us know if you have any problems!
